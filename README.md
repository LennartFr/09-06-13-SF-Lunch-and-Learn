##  IBM Cloud and IBM Blockchain Platform

### Sign-up for [IBM Cloud](https://ibm.biz/Bdzqsf)

<img src="login.png">

#### Run [IBM Blockchain Platform](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?search=blockchain) on the IBM Cloud
- Select the "Blockchain Platform | IBM IAM-enabled" option.  (IAM refers to Identity Access Management)

#### Run a [Kubernetes Cluster](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/cluster) (free) on the IBM Cloud
Kubernetes Service is a managed container service for the rapid delivery of applications that can bind to advanced services like IBM WatsonÂ® and blockchain.

Note: "You can preview the IBM Blockchain Platform at no charge for 30 days when you link your IBM Blockchain Platform service instance to an IBM Cloud - Kubernetes (free cluster).  Performance will be limited by throughput, storage and functionality.  IBM Cloud will delete your Kubernetes cluster after 30 days and you cannot migrate any nodes or data from a free cluster to a paid cluster."

## Development

<img src="VSC_BC.png">

### Prerequisites

#### Linux
Open your terminal environment and update the respositories and installed packages using the following command: <br>
> `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade`

#### Mac OS
We recommend using a package installer like [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to facilitate the installation of packages. <br>
> `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

If needed, there are [other installation options](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) available.

#### Windows
We recommend using a package installer like [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/) to facilitate the installation of packages. <br>
- Install with cmd.exe using the following command: <br>
> `@"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"`

- Install with PowerShell.exe* using the following command: <br>
> `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))`

* An additional step is needed to ensure Get-ExecutionPolicy is not Restricted.

If needed, reference the [installation instructions](https://chocolatey.org/install).

### Required Packages
- Install Docker using `apt`, `brew` or `choco`.
- Install Node (which should install NPM) using `apt`, `brew` or `choco`.
- Install Yeoman using `npm install -g yo`

For reference, [IBM Cloud documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/blockchain?topic=blockchain-develop-vscode#develop-vscode-install) for developing smart contracts with Visual Studio Code extension.

### [Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
Download and Install VS Code - a free source-code editor developed by Microsoft and available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS.  It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control and GitHub, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.

#### [Install IBM Blockchain Platform (extension) for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBMBlockchain.ibm-blockchain-platform)

<img src="architecture.png">
Run IBP on IBM Cloud or locally on your machine.

### Hands-On Lab :ledger:
**Developing Smart Contracts using Visual Studio (VS) Code**

- Ensure you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) installed and the [IBM Blockchain Platform extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBMBlockchain.ibm-blockchain-platform).

In VS Code, go through **Tutorial One**: Local Smart Contract Development. <br>

<img src="VSCODE_TUT1.PNG" width="300" height="500"> <br>
Follow the typical workflow from generating a new smart contract project, deploying code to the <i>local_fabric_runtime</i> and testing your transactions via an <i>application gateway</i>.

### Blockchain Genesis: How did it all start?

During the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, Blockchain was invented by a person (or group of people) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is unknown. 
His whitepaper [BitCoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) is available to read through and focuses on addressing a key problem in electronic commerce:
<p><i><b>
A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution or any intermediary. 
<p> 
Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. 
<p>
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.</i></b> 

### Hyperledger Fabric
Enterprise-grade permissioned distributed ledger platform that offers modularity and versatility for a broad set of industry use cases.
