##  IBM Cloud and IBM Blockchain Platform

### Sign-up for [IBM Cloud](https://ibm.biz/Bdzqsf)

<img src="login.png">

### [IBM Cloud Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog)

### Run [IBM Blockchain Platform](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?search=blockchain) on the IBM Cloud
- Select the "Blockchain Platform | IBM IAM-enabled" option.
(IAM refers to Identity Access Management)

### Run a [Kubernetes Cluster](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/cluster) on the IBM Cloud

Reference: <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-saas-pricing">IBP Pricing</a>
"*Preview the IBM Blockchain Platform at no charge for 30 days when you link your IBM Blockchain Platform service instance to an IBM Cloud Kubernetes (free cluster).  Performance will be limited by throughput, storage and functionality.  IBM Cloud will delete your Kubernetes cluster after 30 days and you cannot migrate any nodes or data from a free cluster to a paid cluster. "

[Install IBM Blockchain Platform VS Code extension for free](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/blockchain?topic=blockchain-develop-vscode#develop-vscode-install)

[Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

[Install IBM Blockchain Platform for VS Code ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBMBlockchain.ibm-blockchain-platform)

Go through Tutorial One in VS Code: Local Smart Contract Development.

Follow the typical workflow from generating a new smart contract project, deploying code to the <i>local_fabric_runtime</i> and testing your transactions via an application gateway</i>

### Blockchain Genesis: How did it all start?

During the Global Financial Crisis in 2008: Oct 2008. <br>
It all started with Satoshi Nakamoto and his whitepaper [BitCoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) which addressed a key problem in electronic commerce:
<p><i><b>
A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution or any intermeditary. 
<p> 
Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. 
<p>
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.</i></b> 

### Hyperledger Fabric
Enterprise grade permissioned distributed ledger platform that offers modularity and versatility for a broad set of industry use cases.
