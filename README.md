## How did it all start?

During the Global Financial Crisis in 2008:<br>

Oct 2008. It all started with Satoshi Nakamoto and his paper [BitCoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) which addressed a key problem in electronic commerce:
<p><i><b>
A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. 
<p> 
Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. 
<p>
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.</i></b> 

## Let's start with Hyperledger Fabric:

"** Preview the IBM Blockchain Platform at no charge for 30 days when you link your IBM Blockchain Platform service instance to an IBM Cloud Kubernetes free cluster. Performance will be limited by throughput, storage and functionality. IBM Cloud will delete your Kubernetes cluster after 30 days and you cannot migrate any nodes or data from a free cluster to a paid cluster. "
